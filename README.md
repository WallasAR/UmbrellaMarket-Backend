This repository contains the Back-End of the **Umbrella Marketplace** application, an e-commerce platform for selling medicines. The API was developed to offer authenticated and well-structured routes to manage users, products and the shopping cart.

## Folder Structure

The API was organized in a modular way, with each functionality in dedicated files to facilitate project maintenance and scalability. Below is the visual structure of the Back-End folders:

```plaintext
UmbrellaMarket-Backend/
│
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── auth.js      # Authentication routes
│   │   ├── cart.js      # Routes for cart management
│   │   └── server.js    # Core Server Configuration and Generic Routes
│   │
│   ├── controllers/     # Controllers to separate logic from routes
│   ├── models/          # Database models
│   └── middlewares/     # Authentication and validation middleware

├── .env                 # Environment variables
├── package.json         # Project dependencies and configurations
└── README.md            # API documentation
```

### Description of Folders

- **`src/routes/`**: Contains all application route files.

  - **`auth.js`**: Authentication-related routes (login, registration, etc.).
  - **`cart.js`**: Routes to manage the shopping cart (add, remove, list items).
  - **`server.js`**: Core server settings such as generic endpoints and initialization.

- **`src/controllers/`**: Place to organize route logic (if necessary).

- **`src/models/`**: Models for interacting with the database.

- **`src/middlewares/`**: Middleware for request validation and user authentication.

---

## API Resources

### 🔑 **Authentication**

- [JWT authentication system](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) to protect routes.
- Middleware to validate tokens and ensure authenticated access.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Main platform for server development.
- **Express.js**: Framework for creating routes and middleware.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.
- **Supabase**: Database.

## How to Run the API

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WalllasAR/UmbrellaMarket-Backend.git
   cd UmbrellaMarket-Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**\
   Create a `.env` file and enter the necessary settings such as the JWT key and database link.

   **Example of `.env`:**

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-instance.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or another configured port).
